# Portfolio assignment - Class 02

## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Let these user stories guide your development:
- As a developer, I want my site to use valid and semantic markup so that employers will love me.
- As the creator, I want the page to link to my social and GitHub pages, so that visitors can follow me and I can build my audience.
- As a developer, I want portfolio items displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it and abstract out the details for individual projects.
- As a developer, I want my CSS organized (think SMACSS) so that I can find my stylings easily.

## User Stories: Stretch Goals
- As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest material on top so that I can easily see the developer's recent work.
- As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on such material to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
- Think of some ideas for your source data, and code it up in its **own file**! Build out an array of three objects to start with, all having similar properties.
- Create JavaScript methods that work with the constructor function you wrote yesterday to modify your source data and render it to the DOM.
- Use good Object Oriented code: attach the constructor function and its associated methods to an object.
- Leave as little in the `window` (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- Use jQuery to `clone` the example markup for each project, as you add additional content.
- Your "Project" prototype should have a `.toHtml()` function that adds new data to the DOM.
- Refactor your CSS into a base, layout, and module structure where applicable.
