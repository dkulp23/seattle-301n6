# Class 2 - jQuery and the DOM

## Daily Plan

1. Code Review
2. jQuery Intro
3. Lab workflow review - how are we doing with Git, upstream, etc?

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that gives developers a new way of interacting with the DOM. In lecture and assignments, you'll get a taste of what it can do and practice using it to build your own apps.
